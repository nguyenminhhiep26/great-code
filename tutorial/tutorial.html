                                    One of the basic nail steps is to clean your nails. First, you must remove the remaining old nail polish with cotton balls and paint remover to help the new polish retain its color and adhere to your nails.

                                    The next step in basic nail polish steps is to soak your nails. After enjoying your modified nails, you need to soak them in a bowl of warm water, maybe a little more lemon juice.

                                    When the nail grows, it will not follow any rules at all. So when you want to retouch your nails, you should edit them as you like. This is an important step to have a perfect nail. This step includes: cutting the nail, cutting the excess skin on both sides of the nail and the tattooed area into the nail, then filing the cut edges.

                                <p class="text-back1">Do not apply colored paint directly to your nails. This will cause the nail polish to get into your nails, making your nails stained and discolored. After wiping off the nail cream, apply 1 coat of topcoat or topcoat before applying the nail polish, which will help keep the color of the nail in place and make the coating stick for longer.</p>

                                    Choose your favorite paint color, paint from the edge of the nail, gently and slowly, will help the paint even more. It is recommended to apply 2 thinner coats than 1 thick coat, that will help the nail polish stay on longer with you. Finally, wait for the paint to dry completely and paint on top of it a glossy paint to put on your new nail your beautiful shirt, and wait nothing more, let's get started."GOOD LUCK".
