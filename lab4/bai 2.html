        <h1>From Garden to Plate</h1>

        <p>A <i>potager</i> is a French term for an ornamental vegetable or kitchen garden. Often flowers (edible and non-edible) and herbsare
            are planted with the vegetables to enhance the garden's beauty. The goal is to make the function of providing food aesthetically pleasing</p>

        <h2>What to Plant</h2>
        <p>Plants are as much for their functionality as for their color and form. Mary are trained to grow upward. A well-designed
            potager can provide food, cut flowers and herbs for the home with very little maintenance. Potagers can disguise their functionof
            of providing for a home in a wide array of foorms - from the carefree style of the cottag garden to the formality of a knot garden.</p>
