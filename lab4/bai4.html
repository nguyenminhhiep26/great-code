        <h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
        <br />
        <p>The cottage garden is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense plantings, and a mixture of </p>
        <p>ornamental and edible plants.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The Cottage Garden originated in <u>England</u> and its history can be traced back for centuries, although they were re-</p>
        <p>invented in 1870's England, when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and rigorously</p>
        <p>maintained <u>English estate gerdens.</u></p>
        <br />
        <p>The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants, with an emphasis on vegetables </p>
        <p>and herbs, along with some fruit trees.</p>
